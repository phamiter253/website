While traveling aboard the luxurious but eerie Nightwing Express, Montgomery awakens to the shocking discovery of a fellow passenger's murder. Trapped on the moving train with a colorful cast of insect passengers, he must use his forensic expertise and keen observational skills to solve the mystery before the train reaches its final destination.
